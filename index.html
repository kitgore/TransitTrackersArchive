                            <p>Our project is the NAU Shuttle Services scheduling web application. Our team, Transit Trackers, aims to address inefficiencies in their current manual scheduling system. By automating and integrating scheduling, driver management, and shift tracking with enhanced data visualization we seek to save time for administrators and improve workflow for drivers.</p>

                            <p>Our system will feature a reactive web app with driver and administrator logins, automated scheduling, shift management, bus assignment, and integrated clock-in data via BusGenius. In addition to this it will include other functionalities such as SMS/email notifications through Twilio.</p>

Twilio will facilitate communication and it will use BusGenius API to compare clock-in data to ensure accurate shift tracking. The system will be available on mobile and desktop browsers ensuring accessibility for all users.</p>
